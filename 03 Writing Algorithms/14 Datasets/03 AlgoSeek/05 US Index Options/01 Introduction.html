<p>The US Index Options dataset by AlgoSeek provides Option data, including prices, strikes, expires, and open interest. The data covers European Option contracts for 3 US Indices: SPX, VIX, and NDX. It starts from January 2012 and is delivered on minute resolution. This dataset is created by monitoring the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) data feed, which consolidates last sale and quotation information originating from the national securities exchanges that have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>The US Index Options dataset depends on the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/quantconnect/download-in-bulk/us-index-option-universe'>US Index Option Universe</a> dataset because the US Index Options Universe dataset contains information on the available contracts, including their daily Greeks and implied volatility values.</p>
