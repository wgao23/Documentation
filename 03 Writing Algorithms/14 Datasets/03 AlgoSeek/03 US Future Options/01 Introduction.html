<p>The US Future Options dataset by AlgoSeek provides Option data on US Future contracts, including prices, strikes, and expires. The data covers 16 Monthly Future contracts, starts in January 2012, and is delivered on a minute frequency. This dataset is created by monitoring the trading activity on the CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX markets.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href='quantconnect.com/datasets/algoseek-us-futures'>US Futures</a> dataset because the US Futures dataset contains data on the underlying Futures contracts. This dataset also depends on the <a href='quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-futures-security-master'>US Futures Security Master</a> because the US Futures Security Master dataset contains information to construct continuous Futures.</p>
